We are a community of people who find top-down organizations such as big banks, big governments, and big tech stifling.  We seek to make bottom-up change through our actions.

## ![Black Flag](/img/black_flag_noclip.png) Mission 1: Real-World Meetups

**We reward people around the world for holding in-real-life (IRL) meetups**.  You can see our [previously funded events](/funded-events) or visit our [Snapshot space](https://snapshot.box/#/s:black-flag.eth) to participate in current funding decisions.
